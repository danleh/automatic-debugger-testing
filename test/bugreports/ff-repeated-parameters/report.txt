Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (both affected, new and old debugger!).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Set breakpoint in line 10 (first line in function).
4. Reload to hit breakpoint.
5. Look at Scopes/Variables in debugger.
6. Click "resume".


Actual results:

- At step 5: Scopes/Variables window shows repeatedParameter with value "first" (wrong)
- After resume: Console shows output of "second" (correct)


Expected results:

- Debugger Scopes/Variables view should be consistent with runtime behavior: Show repeatedParameter with value "second"
