Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (both affected, new and old debugger!).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Reload to enable breakpoint sliding.
3. Set breakpoints and directly remove them again in line 7, 8, 10, and 11.



Actual results:

- Breakpoint in line 7 slides to line 8. Can be removed by clicking on line 8 (expected, correct)
- Breakpoints in line 8 and 10 stay there and can be removed by clicking the line again (expected, correct)
- Breakpoint in line 11 stays in that line. Can neither be removed by clicking on the gutter nor clicking on the "x" in the Breakpoints pane.


Expected results:

- Breakpoint in line 11 should either
a) not be set at all (since there is no valid statement following that it could slide to)
b) be removable.
- Note: Breakpoint in line 12 can be removed again, but I don't know why.

Possibly related: "Cannot remove breakpoint when it's set at non-script area" (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1333219). Although in the other bug a breakpoint is set at a non-script area, not inside the script past the last statement. Can someone reproduce this bug with nightly (where Bug 1333219 is apparently fixed)?
