Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0 beta12 (both affected, new and old debugger!).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Set breakpoints in line 7.
4. Reload.



Actual results:

- Debugger pauses and indicates that the breakpoint in line 7 is hit


Expected results:

- The breakpoint should not be hit!
- NOTE: The if condition is always false (1 !== 1) so the statement in line 7 is never executed. This can also be verified by looking at the console: There is no output, as expected.
- NOTE: adding another statement after the if, e.g. a console.log("blabla"); fixes the issue, then line 7 is no longer hit.
