Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Open example.html in Chromium 58
2. Open DevTools > Debugger
3. Set breakpoint in line 12 (where closing script tag is)
4. Reload

What is the expected behavior?
- Two possiblities: 
a) Breakpoint should stay at line 12 and be hit at the very end of script execution.
b) It should not be possible to set breakpoint there, since there is no statement/meaningful code at this line anyway.

What went wrong?
- After reload breakpoint is moved to line 6 (at the beginning of script) and is hit, i.e., execution pauses at the first statement.
- See attached screencapture for demonstration.

Did this work before? N/A 

Chrome version: 58.0.3029.110 (Developer Build) Built on Ubuntu  Channel: n/a
OS Version: Ubuntu 16.10 (64-bit)
Flash Version: Shockwave Flash 25.0 r0

- Wrapping around of the breakpoint to the beginning is only triggered when line 12 is NOT indented, i.e., when there is no whitespace before the closing </script> tag.
- Adding whitespace (for example one space) to the beginning of line 12 fixes the problem: The breakpoint is not moved to the beginning of the script and it is hit at the very end of the execution of the script.
