Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0 beta12 (both affected).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Set breakpoints in line 7 and line 12 (while loops)
4. Reload to hit first breakpoint.
5. Click "Step In" once.


Actual results:

- Debugger pauses at line 9 (past while loop) after only one step in.
- Confusing, not clear whether all iterations of loop were executed.


Expected results:

- Debugger should pause again at line 7 (where the loop is), at least once per iteration (that is, three times in this case).
- NOTE: How many steps are necessary to get past loop depends on whitespace/formatting. The while-loop in line 12 can be "stepped in" seven times before execution pauses after the loop. See attached screencapture.
