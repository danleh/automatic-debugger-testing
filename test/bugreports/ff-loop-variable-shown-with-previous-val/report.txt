Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (both affected).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Set breakpoints in lines 7, 11, and 15 (for loops).
4. Reload to hit first breakpoint.
5. See debugger Variables/Scopes view.
6. Resume to hit next loop, see debugger Variables/Scopes view again.
7. Resume to hit last loop, see debugger Variables/Scopes view again.


Actual results:

- Variable k of second loop is shown with value 3 in debugger.
- Variable a of third loop is shown with value 7 in debugger.


Expected results:

- k should be either undefined in debugger (like in first loop) or show value after initialization with let k = 4
- a should be either undefined in debugger (like in first loop) or show value after initialization with let a = ""

Note: It seems the value shown in the Debugger is the last value of the previous for loop's variable.
Note: This bug appears even when the loop variables have different names (compare "i" of first loop with "k" of second).
Note: This bug appears even when the loop variable have different types (compare typeof k === number with typeof a === string)
