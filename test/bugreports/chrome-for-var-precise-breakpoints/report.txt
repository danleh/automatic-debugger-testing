Precise/column breakpoint marker at for-loop increment substatement missing

1. Open attached example.html
2. Open Developer Tools -> Debugger
3. Set breakpoints in line 8 and 14 (the for loops)
4. Reload


- the for loops only differ in the declaration of the loop variable (one with let, other with var)
- precise/column/inline breakpoint markers should appear in the same way for both loops
- in particular, there should be a inline breakpoint marker at the i++ increment statement in both loops


- the first loop (where the loop variable is declared with let) gives us an inline breakpoint marker at i++ (correct!)
- the second does not (wrong).
- why is there a difference between let and var-declared loop variables?
