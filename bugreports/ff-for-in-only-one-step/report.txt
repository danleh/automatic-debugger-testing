Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (both affected).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Set breakpoints in lines 10, 15, and 20.
4. Reload to hit first breakpoint.
5. Click "Step In" once


Actual results:

- Debugger pauses at line 14 (after for...in loop!)
- Console shows output of three iterations ("for ... in 1", "for ... in 2", and "for ... in 3")


Expected results:

- Debugger should pause at line 10 again for next iteration
- Console should show output only of first iteration after one step ("for ... in 1")


Note that the stepIn behavior in for...in loop is inconsistent with:

1. Breakpoints in for...in loop: A breakpoint on line 15 is hit 3 times when resuming execution, once per loop iteration. This is expected and correct.
2. Stepping and Breakpoints in for...of loop: stepIn on line 20 correctly executes only one iteration. We need to step multiple times to execute all iterations.

This can also be seen in the video capture (see attachment 2 [details] [diff] [review]).
