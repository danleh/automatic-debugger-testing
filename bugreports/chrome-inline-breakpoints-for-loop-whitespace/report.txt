Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Open example.html in Chromium 58 with new "more preicse"/inline breakpoints feature
2. Open DevTools > Debugger
3. Set breakpoint in line 7 by clicking on gutter
4. Set breakpoint in line 11 by clicking on gutter
5. Set breakpoint in line 17 by clicking on gutter

What is the expected behavior?
at 4.: Should show "inline breakpoint markers" for loop initialization and loop condition in line 11, as it is done for line 7.
at 5.: Should show "inline breakpoint markers" for loop condition and increment in line 17, as it is done for line 7.

What went wrong?
- When for-loop header is on a single line, "precise" breakpoints can be set by clicking on markers inside the line. 
- However, when the for-loop header is distributed over multiple lines (by adding a line break after the loop variable initialization or after loop condition), one cannot set inline breakpoints since those markers are not shown.

Did this work before? N/A
