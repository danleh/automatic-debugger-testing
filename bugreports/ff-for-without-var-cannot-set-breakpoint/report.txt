Steps to reproduce:

1. Open attached example.html in Firefox 53.0 or Firefox Developer Edition 54.0a2 (both affected, new and old debugger!).
2. Open Developer Tools, go to Debugger.
3. Reload once to enable breakpoint sliding.
3. Click on gutter to set breakpoints in line 13 and 21.


Actual results:

- Breakpoint in line 13 is removed and one in line 16 added instead (due to sliding).
- Breakpoint in line 21 is removed and one in line 24 added instead (due to sliding).


Expected results:

- Breakpoint in line 13 should stay and not slide somewhere else.
- Breakpoint in line 21 should stay and not slide somewhere else.
- Note: Chrome 58.0 allows setting breakpoints in lines 13 and 21.
- Note: In both cases (line 13 in a for...in loop, line 21 in a for...of loop) the loop header does not contain a declaration with "var" keyword. In the loops with a "var" declaration, setting breakpoints works (lines 9 and 17).
