# Programs-to-Debug

- ```manual/```: Programs we wrote ourselves, mostly to test JavaScript features >ES5 (which SunSpider doesn't have).
- ```pta-warm-up-quizzes/```: JavaScript puzzlers, taken from the _program testing and analysis_ lecture at TU Darmstadt.
- ```sunspider-determ/```: SunSpider benchmarks, version 1.0.2, with minor changes to fix non-determinism (replacing ```Math.random()``` or constructing a fixed ```Date```).
